# 📊 Yelp Restaurant Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing Yelp's business dataset — particularly restaurant businesses — across 8 major metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada. It involves transforming multiple JSON files into structured tables, performing data analysis, and generating valuable business insights related to ratings, reviews, check-ins, and user engagement.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- The dataset is a subset of Yelp's open data, originally provided in JSON format.
- Five main JSON files were used:
  - `business.json`
  - `user.json`
  - `review.json`
  - `tip.json`
  - `checkin.json`
- Data was cleaned and imported into a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.

## 📈 Analysis Objectives & Key Findings

### 🔹 1. Overview of Restaurant Businesses
- Out of 150,000 businesses, **35,000 open restaurants** were identified.

### 🔹 2. Ratings vs. Review Count
- Businesses with the highest ratings don’t always have the most reviews.
- Review count reflects **user engagement**, not necessarily **customer satisfaction**.

### 🔹 3. Engagement Trends Across Ratings
- **4-star restaurants** showed the **highest average engagement** (reviews, tips, check-ins).
- Engagement declines at 5.0 stars — possibly due to saturation or niche customer base.

### 🔹 4. Correlation of Review, Tip, and Check-In Counts
- Strong correlation observed: **engagement types are interconnected**.
- Increasing one type (e.g., check-ins) likely boosts others.

### 🔹 5. High-rated vs. Low-rated Businesses
- **High-rated restaurants** show greater overall engagement.
- Indicates the importance of **quality and service consistency**.

### 🔹 6. Success Metrics by City
- **Philadelphia** leads in overall restaurant success score.
- Followed by **Tampa, Indianapolis, and Tucson**.

### 🔹 7. Seasonal Patterns
- Trend and seasonality analysis were performed to compare successful and less successful businesses over time.

### 🔹 8. Sentiment Features (Useful, Funny, Cool)
- Sentiment tags were analyzed in reviews/tips to assess customer satisfaction and engagement quality.

### 🔹 9. Elite vs. Non-Elite Users
- **Elite users** contribute more significantly to engagement metrics than regular users.
